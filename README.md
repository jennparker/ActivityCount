# ActivityCount
# Background
The aim of making this app is two-fold. First, I am super excited about learning Kotlin, so while
Java currently remains my first language, I am jumping at every opportunity to get more familiar
with Kotlin...plus Kotlin is SO MUCH FUN to write compared to Java! Second, as someone with ADHD,
I've spent my entire adult life working on hacks to make myself the best learner and worker I can be,
while still nurturing my creative and curious sides. One such hack is setting lots of daily,
bite-sized goals and gamifying the heck out of how I get them accomplished.

# The App
I'm most productive when I set a pomodoro timer for a short time of very focused activity and follow
it up with a short physical activity break. This app will allow me to track what I'm doing during
my activity breaks throughout the day and see a running total as I go.
